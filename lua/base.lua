	------########################## GO HERE TO CHANGE DEFAULT COLOURS #############################------

	-- As of update 3.7 default colours are now saved to your save file, so you dont have to change them every time a patch comes out.
	
	-- You can change your default colours here. To do so, replace default values with your colour of choice.
	-- Valid format for your colour: "Color( 255, R, G, B ) / 255" (without ""), where R G and B stand for 'red' 'green' and 'blue' colour values. RGB values can not be less then 0 or more then 255.
	-- Game uses values between 0 and 1 which scale proportionally to the 255 rgb value, that's why joinList has a value of 1 1 1 1, thats just RGB for 255 255 255.
	-- That's why you can use the /255 at the end - so that you dont have to caluclate the RGB value when its converted to 0-1 range.
	-- If you are wondering, the very first value stands for transparency (i think), so keep it at 1, unless you want blurry and hard to see words.
	-- Also, don't forget about comas at the end of your values, this is an array of values after all.
	-- Reminder: 'menuDefaultColour' is for peer's mod lists and by default is set to a string "default". Crime.net default is 'Color(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)'.
	-- 'joinListDefaultColour' is for the list created when someone is joining your lobby, default value: Color(1, 1, 1, 1).
	
	menuDefaultColour = "default",
	crimenetDefaultColour = Color(0.8, 0.8, 0.8),

-- This "old version upgrade" part is some legacy stuff, and most likely not needed for anyone, other then people who are somewhow still using a version from almost a year ago.
-- Still somewhat usefull if you want to add mod names i guess, but you are better of just adding them to the save file manually.

---------###################### OLD VERSION UPGRADES/MANUAL MOD ADDING GUIDE ###########################---------

-- If you did not use this mod before version 3.0, you dont need this information, unless you want to add mods manualy.

-- Allright, first - old version mod list ports.
-- Mod structure was changed, so now all of your mods are stored in a save file in mods/saves/PMLH_save.txt
-- You won't need to change it, only values below.
-- After this message you can notice a similar list pattern to that in the previous version. However, these values are not changed when you make adjustments in game,
-- all the changes are happening in the save file. These values are 'default' mods, that are written into the save file, if user does not have a save file yet.
-- If you want to move your mods from old version to the new one, or manually add mods, just add them into the values below, and start the game, and you should be good to go.
-- If you are having issues, close the game, remove the save file from saves folder, make sure that your mods are written down in lists below, and you should be fine.
--
-- Visual example on how it should be done:
--
--	Old version that you want to copy stuff from
--	PeerModListHighlights.greenlist = { -- this line is slightly different if you a porting from Crime.net list highlighter, but it does not matter.
--		"ADDEDMOD1", *Only this*
--		"ADDEDMOD2", *this*
--		"ADDEDMOD3" *and this line should be copied*
--	}
--
-- 	New mod version that you want to move stuff to
--		greenlist = {
--			*and pasted over here*
--		},
--
-- In the end your Peer list mod values should look like this:
--	PeerModListHighlights.lists ={
--		greenlist = {
--			"ADDEDMOD1",
--			"ADDEDMOD2",
--			"ADDEDMOD3"
--		},
--		yellowlist = {
--			"NEWBIES GO BACK TO OVERKILL"
--		},
--		redlist = {
--			"SILENT ASSASSIN"
--		}
--	}
--
--	P.S. Obiuously you can add mods not just to green list, i just didnt want to make a really lengthy example showcase
--
-- Manual mod adding process:
-- Some info from the message above (with porting) can be useful to you, but whatever.
-- If you want to add mods manualy, you need to add them IN CAPS into the lists below.
-- Dont forget "" symbols to put your mod name within and to put a comma after a mod's name like in example above or list below
-- However, this way you only add 'default' mods that are written into the save file if you dont have a save file yet, on the first boot up of the game with this mod installed.
-- You can remove the save file (location: mods/saves/PMLH_save.txt) and start the game to reset them to these defaults.
--
-- If you want to add mods after the save file was created, you need to go the save file mentioned above, and change values there.
-- Over there logic is pretty much the same, only caps, commas after every name. It is a bit harder to read because it's in one line though, but i believe you will manage that :)
-- If your game crashes on start up after you tinkered with save files, you probably made a typo
